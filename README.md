# Hi I'm Manthan 👋

Engineer at Stripe. Previously AWS.

### 🔨 What I'm working on

**[RunbookAI](https://github.com/Runbook-Agent/RunbookAI)** — an open-source AI agent that investigates production incidents. Hypothesis-driven, runbook-aware, approval-gated. Born from too many on-call shifts.

**[context-ledger](https://github.com/manthan787/context-ledger)** — local-first CLI that tracks your AI coding sessions and hands off context between them.

**[Openweavr](https://github.com/openweavr/Openweavr)** — self-hosted workflow automation with AI agents.

### 🧪 Other things I've built

🎵 **[Fiddler](https://github.com/fiddler-project/fiddler)** — AI music composer using RNNs and Seq2Seq.

🧠 **[malloc](https://github.com/manthan787/malloc)** — thread-safe memory allocator in C (buddy allocation).

📡 **[Hitch](https://github.com/manthan787/hitch)** — cross-platform AirDrop using Zeroconf.
